# CITY 77
A custom Garry’s Mod loading screen built for City 77 (Vladivostok), a post-war reclamation and resource-processing hub within the Half-Life 2 universe.

The design goal is minimalism with diegetic presentation.

## Setting Context

City 77 (Vladivostok) is a post-Portal Storm industrial reclamation zone activated years after the Seven Hour War. Once dormant, the city now functions as a critical resource extraction and processing node supporting Combine logistics and xenium refinement operations tied to nearby dimensional anomalies.
